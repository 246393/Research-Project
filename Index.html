            Why does music sound different with headphones?
            Through the question, different types of headphones are to be introduced, and let's
         dive into the world of headphones.

        <h1 class="text-center pb-1 fw-bold" id="about">Why does music sound different with headphones?</h1>
        <p>
          The difference in music due to the use of headphones is due to many reasons. 
          One of the biggest differences is noise isolation. 
          It can come into play as noise-canceling headphones with its active and passive noise cancellation. 
          All headphones, except for on-ear ones, have passive noise cancellation.
           Passive noise cancellation is achieved by the physical ear cups and the in-ear tips blocking out the noise from the outside. 
           The thick covers aren't only there to provide support and comfort but also act as a noise-damping device.
            By either plugging in the ear canal with an in-ear tip or covering it up with an ear cup, the user is able to focus better on their music and reduce listening fatigue.
             
        </p>

        <p>
          The human mind is always trying to focus on specific sounds, and headphones do all the selecting for them, so the user can relax. 
          The human ear registers sound through sound waves going into the ear canal right against the eardrum. 
          It helps create the illusion that the music is coming from the head.
           Due to the personal nature of headphones, they can be customized to make them more personalized.
            Many headphones come in modes that can increase extension extremes, activate spatial audio effects, adjust the source of audio, and create a close-proximity listening experience.
            Headphones create a level of intimacy with the music because only the user can experience them and adjust to their heart's content.

                            An in-ear headphone is any headphone that is inserted into the ear. Which would also include earbuds of both the wireless and wired types. The earbud sits at the ear cannel, providing a more isolated listening experience. With the added bonus of noise cancellation, Earbuds are as popular, if not more, as over-the-ear headphones.
                            This includes hearing aids and IEMs. IEM stands for In-Ear Monitors, which would include all the earbuds singers and people in entertainment and news broadcasters wear.

                        <p>
                            Most in-ear headphones come wireless with the help of Bluetooth to conceal the appearance of their headphones.
                            It is most commonly used during exercise due to its light weight.
                            Some popular brands of earbuds are AirPod, Raycon, Galaxy Buds, and many more, since companies also sell other types of headphones along with the earbuds.

                             Fun fact, earbuds is one of the many names called for a headphone. Some popular colors for the earbuds are more vibrant in color than the other headphone counterparts. 
                          Includes: rose gold, royal blue, white, black, and gray.

                              On-ear headphones are overlooked in the headphone world. When searching for headphones, most people look for over-ear headphones.
                               There are some advantages to using an on-ear headphones. As the name states, the cups of the headphones sit on top of the ears of the user.
                                Depending on the user, it can be more comfortable to use a smaller earcup. When used with on-the-ear headphones, it can relieve some pressure.
                                 Due to the smaller nature of their cups, they are also lighter than over-the-ear headphones. The added bonus of the smaller nature of the headphones lets the user be able to hear the ambient sounds. 
                                 Ambient sounds are important in areas of heavy traffic and high population due to the need for alertness in dense areas. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Due to the uptake of better noise-canceling from over-the-ear headphones, on-ear headphones are harder and harder to find. On-ear headphones come in both wireless and wired versions. 
                              Some popular brands include SkullCandy, Jabra, Grado, and Senheiser.
                               The smaller ear cups all come down to preference since some people say it's more comfortable to wear on-ear, while most disagree.

                              When thinking about headphones, the first image that comes to mind is most likely an over-ear headphones.
                              With its powerful noise-canceling quality, it's getting more and more popular over time. While wireless is most popular, many artists use over-ear headphones when creating their songs. The isolation of their song from the outside world is something they value greatly. As the name suggests, the headphone's cups sit over the user's ear, creating a seal for noise cancellation. 

                            </p>
                    
                            <p>
                              The benefits of an over-ear headphone are comfort and noise cancellation. 
                              With comfort, since the cups of the headphones aren't directly on the ear, it takes away the pressure from the ear.
                               The noise cancellation comes in active and passive versions. Passive noise cancellation is used to isolate irregular and high-frequency sounds.
                                The benefits are that it's a physical barrier that doesn't need power to function. Ideal for concerts with high volumes. 
                                Active, on the other hand, needs energy to work and targets ambient sounds, which are in the low to medium pitch range. 
                                This is the noise-canceling people think of when they just turn it on and their cafe turns quiet. 
                                Perfect for airplane travel, with the constant chatter and hum of the plane. The headphone comes in all different types of colors. 
                                Popular colors include: red, black, silver, white, and blue.

            <p>
              Telephones required two hands to operate, so the headphone was invented in the 1910s. 
              The use of the headphone was expanded by the Holtzer-Cabot Company by Nathaniel Baldwin, who supplied them to the military. 
              The headphones weren't safe for ordinary people to use.
              The dangerous volatges can get the user shocked when touched with bare hands.
               However, John C. Koss wanted to expand the usage of headphones even more because they were mainly still used for communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1950s, he made the first stereo headphones that were both affordable and had great sound quality.
               The technology of headphones increased exponentially when the first digital hearing aid was produced in the 1980s.
                The popularity of the headphones increased due to the popularity of the Walkman. 
                Another breakthrough in technology in the headphone world came with Active Noise Cancellation in the late 1980s.

              There is a society dedicated to headphones called the Audio Engineering Society. 
              Only professionals who are passionate about audio technology can go. 
              It was founded in the US in 1948.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              It is now an international organization that brings audio engineers, creative artists, scientists, and students together. 
              The purpose of the organization is to promote advances in audio and discuss new knowledge and findings about audio technology.
               Also includes companies that sell audio products like Bose and Dolby.
